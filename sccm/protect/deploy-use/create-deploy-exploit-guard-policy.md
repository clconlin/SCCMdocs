# Create and deploy an Exploit Guard policy <!--1355468 -->

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

You can configure and deploy Configuration Manager policies that manage all four components of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/windows-defender-exploit-guard). These components include:
-   Attack Surface Reduction
-   Controlled folder access
-   Exploit protection
-   Network protection

Compliance data for Exploit Guard policy deployment is available from within the Configuration Manager console.

## Prerequisites

Managed devices must run Windows 10 1709 Fall Creators Update or later and satisfy the following requirements depending on the components and rules configured:

|Exploit Guard component |Additional prerequisites|
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Attack Surface Reduction  | Devices must have [Windows Defender AV real-time protection]( https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/controlled-folders-exploit-guard) enabled.  |
| Controlled folder access  | Devices must have [Windows Defender AV real-time protection]( https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/controlled-folders-exploit-guard) enabled.   |
| Exploit protection  | None  |
| Network protection  |  Devices must have [Windows Defender AV real-time protection]( https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/controlled-folders-exploit-guard) enabled.  |

## Create an Exploit Guard policy

>[!NOTE]
>In version 1710, Windows Defender Exploit Guard policy is a pre-release feature. To enable it, see [Use pre-release features from updates](/sccm/core/servers/manage/install-in-console-updates#bkmk_prerelease).

1.	In the Configuration Manager console, go to **Assets and compliance** > **Endpoint Protection**, and then click **Windows Defender Exploit Guard**.
2.	On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Exploit Policy**.
3.	On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify a name, and optional description for the configuration item.
4.	Next, select the Exploit Guard components you want to manage with this policy. For each component you select, you can then configure additional details.
    - **Attack Surface Reduction:** Configure the Office threat, scripting threats, and email threats you want to block or audit. You can also exclude specific files or folders from this rule.
    - **Controlled folder access:** Configure blocking or auditing, and then add Apps that can bypass this policy.  You can also specify additional folders that are not protected by default.
    - **Exploit protection:**  Specify an XML file that contains settings for mitigating exploits of system processes and apps. You can export these settings from the Windows Defender Security Center app on a Windows 10 device.
    - **Network protection:** Set network protection to block or audit access to suspicious domains.
5.	Complete the wizard to create the policy, which you can later deploy to devices.

### Deploy an Exploit Guard policy     
After you create Exploit Guard policies, use the Deploy Exploit Guard Policy wizard to deploy them. To do so, open the Configuration Manager console to **Assets and compliance** > **Endpoint Protection**, and then click **Deploy Exploit Guard Policy**.
